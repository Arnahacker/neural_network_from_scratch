# Neural Network From Scratch (NumPy)

A fully-from-scratch implementation of a **neural network in Python using NumPy** — including forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent — built to understand deep learning fundamentals without any frameworks.  
Tested on **XOR**, **Make Moons**, **Iris**, **MNIST**, and **Sine Curve regression** examples.

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates the inner workings of a neural network — from the math of gradient descent to the code behind activations and losses.  
Every layer, weight update, and derivative is manually implemented for complete transparency.

### Goal
To **learn deep learning by building it**, not by using black-box libraries.

---

## Key Features
- Build and train neural networks **from scratch** using NumPy  
- Implement **forward and backward propagation** manually  
- Support for **dense layers**, **activations**, **losses**, and **optimizers**  
- Modular architecture for easy extension  
- Visualize training performance (loss and accuracy)  
- Example scripts for both classification and regression tasks
