# neural_network_from_scratch
A fully-from-scratch implementation of a neural network in Python using NumPy — including forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent — built to understand deep learning fundamentals without any frameworks. Tested on XOR, Make Moons, Iris, MNIST, and Sine Curve regression examples.
